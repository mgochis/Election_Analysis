This script was used to analyze this election data by counting the total number of votes, votes by county and votes by candidate. This same script can be modified in several different ways to help analyze future election data. One example would be to use the script to count the number of votes by county and candidate. This would draw a clear picture of which county preferred which candidate. If in future elections there is more data available, like political party for example, the script could be updated to count the votes of each party by county wish would also open up more information based on each counties political biases.
